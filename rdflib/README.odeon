new features:
- multi-line literals in SPARQL (delimited by """)
- graph.removeN(quads) where "quads" is a list of quads (lists or tuples) - executes a single DELETE query and the speed is optimal for around 100 quads removed in a row
- don't escape quotes when normalizing literals (DB-API takes care of the escaping when building the SQL)

dependencies:
- pyparsing for the SPARQL parser
